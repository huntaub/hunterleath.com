        I'm a Third Year studying Computer Science and Economics
        at the University of Virginia. Currently, you can find me
        working in the <a href="http://www.jeffersonswheel.org/">Security
          Group</a> on my decentralized social
        platform, <a href="http://getmelange.com">Melange</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, I will post on
        my <a href="http://twitter.com/huntaub">Twitter</a>, but the
        recommended way to reach me is via email: <br/> h [AT]
        hunterleath.com.
      </p>
      <p>I'm also on Melange as hleath@airdispatch.me</p>
      <p>
        This blog will contain my thoughts about Security as well as
        interesting topics related to Economics. Stay tuned. If you
        want to learn more about what I do, head on over
        to <a href="/about">About Me</a>. For code, go
        to <a href="https://github.com/huntaub">my GitHub</a>.
